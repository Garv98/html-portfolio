<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Garv Agarwalla, an aspiring engineer with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
  Currently pursuing my B.E. at RVCE, Bangalore, I have maintained a stellar academic record with a CGPA of 9.79. 
  My technical expertise spans programming languages like C, Python, and MySQL, along with frameworks such as TensorFlow and OpenCV. 
  I have a deep interest in data structures, blockchain technology, and cyber-physical systems, which I have applied in various 
  projects, including a quantum-based diabetic retinopathy detection model and a Twitter replica using fundamental data structures. 
  My research contributions include a published paper on AI-driven pathogen profiling using NLP, showcasing my dedication to 
  advancing AI in healthcare and scientific literature analysis.

<p>Beyond academics, I actively participate in technical and community initiatives. I competed in the "Build with Gen AI" Hackathon 
  and contribute to projects like "Project Pustak 2024" and "Fist Full" through the Rotaract Club of RVCE. 
  My interests extend to traveling, listening to music, and playing cricket, which help me maintain a well-rounded approach to life. 
  I am always eager to explore cutting-edge AI applications and leverage my skills to solve real-world problems, 
  particularly in healthcare and cybersecurity.</p>
